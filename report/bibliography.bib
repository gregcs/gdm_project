ABSTRACT = {Identifying stops from GPS trajectories is one of the main concerns in the study of moving objects and has a major effect on a wide variety of location-based services and applications. Although the spatial and non-spatial characteristics of trajectories have been widely investigated for the identification of stops, few studies have concentrated on the impacts of the contextual features, which are also connected to the road network and nearby Points of Interest (POIs). In order to obtain more precise stop information from moving objects, this paper proposes and implements a novel approach that represents a spatio-temproal dynamics relationship between stopping behaviors and geospatial elements to detect stops. The relationship between the candidate stops based on the standard time&ndash;distance threshold approach and the surrounding environmental elements are integrated in a complex way (the mobility context cube) to extract stop features and precisely derive stops using the classifier classification. The methodology presented is designed to reduce the error rate of detection of stops in the work of trajectory data mining. It turns out that 26 features can contribute to recognizing stop behaviors from trajectory data. Additionally, experiments on a real-world trajectory dataset further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving the accuracy of identifying stops from trajectories.},

ABSTRACT = {Trajectories, representing the movements of objects in the real world, carry significant stop/move semantics. The detection of trajectory stops poses a critical problem in the study of moving objects and becomes even more challenging due to the inevitable noise recorded along with true data. To extract stops with a variety of shapes and sizes from single trajectories with noise, this paper presents a sequence oriented clustering approach, in which noise points within the sequence of a stop can be identified and classified as a part of the stop. In our method, two key concepts are first introduced: (1) a core sequence that defines sequence density based not only on proximity in space but also continuity in time as well as the duration over time; and (2) an Eps-reachability sequence that aggregates core sequences that overlap or meet over time. Then, three criteria are presented to merge Eps-reachability sequences interrupted by noise. Further, an algorithm, called SOC (Sequence Oriented Clustering), is developed to automatically extract stops from a single trajectory. In addition, a reachability graph is designed that visually illustrates the spatio-temporal clustering structure and levels of a trajectory. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated against two baseline methods through extensive experiments based on real world trajectories, some with serious noise, and the results show that our approach is fairly effective in recognizing trajectory stops.},
